# Web Application Architecture

## Basic App Structure
- one "box" or "machine"
- Typically rented on Elastic Compute Cloud
  - Many "server" programs run on the machine
    - Application server
    - Web application server (Webrick, Thin, Puma)
    - Application (Rails, Sinatra)
    - Database Server (PostgreSQL)
- AWS will give you an AWS-specific domain name for your box; you configure your nameserver to identify your own domain with this domain (CNAME record)

## Basic App Performance
App Server
  - Rails logic is written in Ruby which can execute slowly
    - You can use jRuby to run your Ruby code faster
  - Webrick is designed to be simple; it's slow (~100 req/sec)
  - Puma is multithreaded; it's fast (~2k req/sec)
PostgreSQL
  - Very high read rates (~80k reads per second)
    - this only applies if data is resident in the RAM
  - Much Lower Write rates ~2.5k writes per seconds
    - this is because PostgreSQL needs to always write to disk to achieve durability
    - number quoted is for SSD. In rotational days, it was much lower.
    - Using rotation drives, write raters of ~700 rec/sec is achievable with RAID.

## Improving Basic App Performance:
- Scale up: make your machine powerful
- Add more CPU's or faster CPU's or CPU's with more cores
  - will improve app server and DB Performance
- Add more RAM
  - will esp improve DB read performance
- Replace rotational disks with SSD use RAID
  - Will esp improve DB write performance
- Each of these improvements only cost money

## Scaling
NGINX is widely-used and more secure, reliable
- Scale out, add more machines
- Run NGINX on its own box
- All app servers still talk to the same DB server
- App machines are low-end and inexpensive
  - more cost efficient

## Scales out DB reads:
  - increasing the umber of app machines doesn't help distribute load on DB server
  - read load is often much greater than write load
  - simply distributing read load is therefore a huge Windows
  - a simple setup to distribute
