# Negotiation

Upside:
- more money
- more options (stock options, better hours WFH)
- shows confidence
- shows self-worth and value
- transparency
- shows how much a company values employees
- peace of mind

Downside:
- Risky
- Cockiness
- Uncomfortable

## Rule no. 1: Never give a salary at the start

## Rule no. 3: Don't negotiate over the phone
- ask for more time
- know your ideal salary
- if they name a number, repeat the number and then pause for 10 counts
- make sure the offer is firm - move communication to email


## Equity

Salary is guaranteed. Equity isn't.

Equity - any kind of ownership of the company.
Stock that you buy or that is given to you.
Options to buy stock.
Usually vests over 4 years with a 1-year cliff.
Income is taxed.
Equity can be diluted.
Equity = gambling. Most startups don't win big.
Get runway and valuation from any startup.
