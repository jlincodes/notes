```Ruby
def example1(n)
  n = 3n + 2
  n += 40n
  n**5
end
```
Constant - no matter how large n is, the number of actions stays the same


```Ruby
def example2(n)
  n.times { |i| p i }
end
```
Linear


```Ruby
def example3(n)
  t = 0
  n.times do
    n.times do
      t+=1
    end
  end
  p t
end
```


```Ruby
def example4(n)
  t = 0
  (1..n).each do |i|
    i.times do
      t += 1
    end
  end
  p t
end
```
n(n+1)/2
Quadratic

```Ruby
def example5(n)
  while n > 0
    n /= 2
  end
end
```
logrithmic - reducing the number of actions before stopping condition by half


```Ruby
def example6(n)
  return 1 if n == 0
  example6(n-1)
end
```
linear - n times

```Ruby
def example7(n)
  return 1 if n.even? || n < 0
  example7(n-2)
end
```
linear - worst case
constant - best case


```Ruby
def example8(n)
  return 1 if n == 0
  example8(n-1) * example8(n-1)
end
```
2^n-1 - exponential

```Ruby
def example9(n)
  return 1 if n == 0
  n.times { p n } if n.odd?
  example9(n-1) * example9(n-1)
end
```

```Ruby
def example10(n)
  t = 0
  n.times do
    n.times do
      t += 1
      t.to_s.split.each { |e| p el}
    end
  end
  p t
end
```
nested loop - n^2
log n

```Ruby
def example 11(n)
  n.times do |i|
    j = i
    while j < n
      j *= 2
    end
  end
end
```
logrithmic
nlog

```Ruby
def example12(n)
  p n
  n.times do
    example12(n-1)
  end
end
```

# Mentat

Five questions that you could ask anyone during a networking event:
- What technological challenges does your company face?
- What technologies does your company use?
- What projects are you currently working on?
- What do you enjoy about your role at XYZ company?
