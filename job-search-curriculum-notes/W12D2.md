# Dynamic Array
Uses a StaticArray as its store, initialized to 8
Capacity is tracked separatately from length, so we can know when to resize
Validates indices for bracket methods
Raises OOB Error for people
Resizes when pushing/unshifting on to a full Array
Resize uses amortization! Creates a new store and copies over all elements
Shift/Unshift reassigns each value, O(n)

# Ring Buffer

Include a new instant variable start_idx
by making our bracket methods dependent on (start_idx + index) % capacity we can proceed by using bracket method

# Queue
Enqueue will push the new element into our maxque (as well as the store) and eject all elements from the back that are less than the new element, until we hit one that is greater or equal. There ejected elements will never be the max because they will be dequeued from the main store before this new element. Notice that each element is only pushed of ejected onto maxque once so time complexity amortizes. We never have to consider n elements over and over again because an element is either ejected or causes early stopping.

Dequeue from the store, shift off from the maxque if it matches the element being dequeued; if it matches we are losing our current max and must take it off the list
