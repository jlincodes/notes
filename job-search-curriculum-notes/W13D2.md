# Topological Sort
```Ruby
def topological_sort(vertices)
queue = []
in_edge_count = {}

  vertices.each do |vertex|
    in_edge_count[vertex] = vertex.in_edges.length
    if vertex.in_edges.empty?
      queue << vertex
    end
  end

  sorted = []

  until queue.empty?
    current = queue.shift
    sorted << current
    current.out_edges.each do |edge|
      in_edges_count[edge.to_vertex] -= 1
      return [] if in_edge_count[edge.to_vertex] < 0
      queue << edge.to_vertex if in_edge_count[edge.to_vertex] == 0
    end
  end

  return [] if in_edge_count.values.any? { |count| count != 0 }
  sorted
end

# Tarjan's Algorithm
Tarjan's Algorithm uses DFS to explore nodes until they have no children or no unvisited children.
Once a node's connections have been exhausted it is unshifted onto the result. Nodes that have the 'later' dependences will be processed before those that have 'earlier' ones. Each node and edge is visited once so time complexity is linear.
Cycle catching is a little tricky.

# Dynamic Programming

Improving performance of your solutions using methods that reuse work that you've already done.

## Two different paradigms
## Top down
- often referred to as 'memoization'
- typical of recursive implementations that depend on solutions further down the chain
- build your stacks and save the work to a cache as you bubble up - subsequent calls to the same function within any give stack can pull the answer out of the cache without incurring more function calls

## Bottom up
- users smaller solutions

Fibonacci - why is this not great?
two recursive calls - exponential complexity

Top-down Fibonnaci:
```ruby
class Fibonacci
  def initialize
    @cache = { 1 => 1, 2 => 1 }
  end

  def fibonacci(n)
    # return 1 if n == 1 || n == 2
    # Check our cache instead of the original base case
    return @cache[n] unless @cache[n].nil?

    # Record our answer in our cache before returning it
    ans = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
    @cache[n] = ans
    return ans
  end
end
```

Bottom-up Fibonnaci:
```ruby
def fib_cache_builder(n)
  # Builds the cache, starting at 1 and ending at n
  cache = { 1 => 1, 2 => 1 }
  return cache if n < 3
  (3..n).each do |i|
    cache[i] = cache[i - 1] + cache[i - 2]
  end

  cache
end

def fibonacci(n)
  # Calls the helper function
  cache = fib_cache_builder(n)
  # Returns the nth entry
  cache[n]
end
```

## LONGEST INCREASING SUBSEQUENCE
Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence

Ex. [1,5,2,5,10,4,20] => 5, [1,2,6,10,20]

Take a bottom-up approach
```Ruby
longest = Array.new(arr.size { Array.new})

(1...arr.size).each do |i|
  (0...i).each do |j|
    if arr[j] < arr[i] && longest[i].size < longest[j].size + 1
      longest[i] = longest[j].dup
    end
  end
end

longest[i] << arr[i]

longset.max_by(&:length).length
```

The key to solving these types of problems is defining the recursive relationship
What is the relationship between a given solution and other solutions that lead up to it
