# Variations - Algorithms

- HackerRank style
  - make sure you practice with it
  - should be used to the Stdin/Stdout paradigm; don't waste time
  - make sure you're used to how data gets input in the code; strings!

# Variations - Takehomes
- different timing schemes
- build a frontend that uses our API - mockups, interactivity, etc.
- build a piece of backend functionality - API endpoint, dataset parser, build a RDBMS, etc
- build a full-stack mini-site - use this data, implement a system that accesses and updates it from the frontend
- More vague - build something that does "this"
