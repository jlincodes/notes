## Weekend to-do list:
- go over JS curriculum
- do JS tutorial (Codecademy? Sololearn?)
- think of possible project ideas:
- submit FSP to Jobberwocky



gearing up for the job search
the weekend: JS project proposal (due Monday @ 9AM)
familiarize yourself with the job search curriculum

#Overview

roll call Monday @ 1:30 pm; afterwards every day 9 am
everyone will get 1-on-1 job search coach
3 projects: full stack, JS project, flex project
Lots to do: resume, cover letter, interview prep
Less structure, but generally:
- work time mornings
- lectures/mock interviewing
- algorithm projects

#strike system
5 strikes = tuition -> flat fee/removal from job search support
##Strike offenses:
- missing roll call
- not returning emails
- not meeting application quotas
- not meeting deadlines
- incomplete projects
- not passing specs on algorithm projects
Every Friday, strike count reduces by 1
designed to keep you on track and get you employed. System of accountability.

#JS projects:
why?
everyone uses JS
OOP skills
create beautiful product
supplements your FSP as another coding example

project requirements:
no tutorials or overuse of libraries. do your research and justify your choices
can be a game but something original is best
can be a data visualization project
choose something with an appropriate scope (only 4 days - morning and evenings - to complete)
must show off front end skills - make it pretty

#easy projects
pro: less time intensive
con: makes it difficult to stand out to employers

#medium
not a huge step beyond easy projects but a bit more unique

#add a backend
building a basic node backend could be a nice addition to your project but requires a lot of additional work
- 1 or 2 routes
- saves user
- must be made during the weekend

#JS project pet peeves
- music that doesn't stop
- projects that aren't responsive
- games starts playing immediately after losing
- projects without clear instructors to the user
- bad styling, bad fonts

#TA Support & Schedule
- No project managers - must manage your own timeline and progress
- Will be checking in along the way
- Less TA support than during FSP
- Regular office hours with Dallas, Andrew, Josh, Sean, Jared, Greg & James


#JS Project Proposal Guidelines
- MVP Features - be detailed!
- Technologies - Do your research
- Wireframes - this is a frontend project
- Work you accomplished over the weekend (tutorial, skeletons, proof of concept)
- Timeline - Be detailed.
