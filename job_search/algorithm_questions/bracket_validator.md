Let's say:

'(', '{', '[' are called "openers."
')', '}', ']' are called "closers."

Write an efficient function that tells us whether or not an input string's openers and closers are properly nested.

Examples:

`"{ [ ] ( ) }"` should return `true`
`"{ [ ( ] ) }"` should return `false`
`"{ [ }"` should return `false`
