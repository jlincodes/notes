## One Away
There are 3 types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert character, remove character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

Example:
pale, ple => true
pales, pale => true
pale, bale => true
pale, bake => false

```JavaScript
const oneAway = (str1, str2) => {
  let edits = 0;


};
```
