## [How to prepare for Tech Interviews - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jov24/heres_how_to_prepare_for_tech_interviews/?compact=true)

### Data Structures
Know the Big-O for insert, delete, lookup, etc. for each of these. Know how the mechanics work.
- Array
- Linked List
- Stack/Queue
- Trees (Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc. Learn as many as you can)
- Heap
- Hash Table (this is really important - understand all of the different collision mitigation mechanisms, understand what amortized constant-time means)
- Directed/Undirected/Weighted Graphs
- Trie (pronounced "tree")M
- Linked Hash Map (this is very specific, but comes up a LOT in interviews)


### Algorithms
Know all of the Big-O for this and how it's derived.
You don't have to go crazy here, but review a couple of:
- Sorting algorithms (both comparison sorting and non-comparison sorting)
- Tree traversals (just memorize all of these inorder, preorder, postorder, level order)
- Traversals - Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS (know the difference between DFS and BFS when would you use one over the other and why - hint, is usually matters when you don't have to search the whole space. Also make sure that you can code recursively and using your own stack/queue)
- All the prefix-tree searches
