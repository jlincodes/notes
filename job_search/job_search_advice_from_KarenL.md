## Job Search Advice from Karen L. (LinkedIn)

## What resources did you use to look for jobs?
- Responses from cold-applications is very seldom.
- Instead, go to networking events and meetups
  - Meet people and tell them about your projects and what you've learned from them.
  - Tell them about challenges/problems you faced and how you approached and fixed them.
- LinkedIn and AngelList are good
- Try Hired.com (similar to Triplebyte)
  - create a fake account to attempt the coding challenge and see how far you can get.
## How to study for technical job interviews?
- Building projects are great (both for practice and to have projects to show), but spend part of your time on projects
- Spend the majority of your time practicing for interviews
- Read books on programming (for UI, try Jon Duckett web design books; for JS, try A Smarter Way to Learn JS)
- Study vanilla JS
  - JS libraries are useful, however, they can be learned very quickly on the job. It is a better use of time to learn vanilla JS (like learning how to make an AJAX call in vanilla JS vs using jQuery) because it shows that an understanding of what is happening 'under the hood' of JS libraries.

### What kind of questions (technical & non-technical) have you been asked?
- Google "commonly asked technical questions for frontend development"
- Utilize Glassdoor
- Look for patterns in interviewer questions - there are some questions that are asked more frequently than others
- Create a "cheat sheet" for frequently asked interview questions; making the cheatsheet will help solidify your understanding of those questions

## During an interview...
- When you're caught off-guard by a technical question:
  - Say you're given a problem that isn't exactly how you're used to seeing the problem, rephrase the problem in a way that you're more familiar with or buy yourself some time by telling the interviewer "can you give me a moment while I digest the problem"
  - ask clarifying questions:
    - "Can the integers in the array be negatives or are they all greater than zero?"
    - "What edge cases should I expect?"

## When answering the "tell me about yourself" question, how do you frame the bootcamp coding experience to make yourself sound less junior?
- If you have a friend who is working on a project or trying to build a startup, do some contract work for your friend and build out parts of that project or startup product.
  - Even if it is unpaid, it's good work experience that you can add to your resume to look less junior.
- Build a more substantial project outside of a/A's curriculum.


## Other tips:
- How long was your job search?
  - 6 months
- If you feel like you've hit a slump in the job search, try OutCo
  - OutCo is a crashcourse on interviewing
  - Program is geared towards bookcamp grads
  - Say that you were referred by Karen.
- Try an apprenticeship
  - LinkedIn's apprenticeship, REACH, is geared towards people who have been out of the industry for a while and bootcamp graduates.
    - 6-month program where you work and gain work experience.
    - similar to contract-to-hire positions
- General interviewing tip:
  - Be someone others would want to work with.
  - If you get to the last step in the interviewing process or get an offer, ask to meet the team and/or have lunch with them.
